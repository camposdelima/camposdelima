I am a full-stack software engineer, SRE, architect, and DevOps enthusiast. I spend a lot of time programming, configuring, hacking, and creating tech things.

I have been working with some of the top commercial companies, which is fantastic, but I can't share the majority of my code here. Even so, I have been sharing what I could.
